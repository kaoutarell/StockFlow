# StockFlow

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), designed as an **inventory management system** for the **SOEN 357** course project. Built with **React, TypeScript, and Next.js**, StockFlow helps track, manage, and optimize inventory workflows.

_(Note: This project is currently **in progress** and will be deployed on **Vercel** upon completion.)_

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

## Deployment

Once completed, StockFlow will be deployed on **Vercel**, the optimal platform for Next.js applications.
